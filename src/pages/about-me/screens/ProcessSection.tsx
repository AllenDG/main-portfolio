            Note: I am familiar with Git flow and experienced in collaboration
            using ticketing tools such as ClickUp. I enjoy contributing in team
            environments and continuously enhance my workflow by applying modern
            development practices, including layered architecture, Vite, and
            modern CSS component libraries. I am also experienced in Agile
            methodology, actively participating in ceremonies such as sprint
            planning, daily standups, retrospectives, and backlog refinement to
            ensure smooth collaboration and continuous delivery.
